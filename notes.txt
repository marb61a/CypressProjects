Cypress Testing
    - https://www.cypress.io/ 
    - Before Cypress a tester would have to use multiple tools including
        - A framework such as Mocha, Karma, Jasmine
        - An assertion library like Chai or Expect.js
        - Install the Selenium package
        - Selenium wrappers such as Protractor, Nightwatch and Webdriver
        - Cypress replaces all of this
    - Cypress does not use Selenium and has a different architecture
        - Selenium executes remote command through the network
        - Cypress runs in the same loop as the application 
    - Cypress is not a general automation tool it is an end to end testing tool (E2E)
    - Cypress will work with any framework and on any website
        - It does not matter the JS framework or if the pages are server rendered
    - Cypress tests are written in JavaScript
    - Cypress can be used by both developers and QA testers
    - Cypress runs faster than other frameworks both from  its architecture
        - Also the fact that development can happen simultaneously to testing speeds up the process

Differences between Cypress and Others (Pros and Cons)
    - Ease of setup
        - A single command using npm to Install -> npm install cypress --save-dev
    - Speed and stability
        - Uses JS the main web language and runs inside the browser
    - Flake Resistant
        - Cypress is notified quickly when the page loads and unloads
        - It is impossible for Cypress to miss elements when events are fired
    - API testing
        - Cypress has the ability to test and mock API
    - JavaScript
        - There is a need to know JavaScript
    - Mobile Testing
        - Although viewport adjustment is available there is no support for mobile testing
    - Domain and Tabs
        - There is only a single domain and tab available
    - Dashboard Service
        - In order to have a large amount of tests and recordings it is necessary to use the dashboard Service
        - This is a monthly fee which also helps pay for continued development of Cypress

Opening Cypress
    - Use the following command to open Cypress
        - ./node_modules/.bin/ cypress open
        - This can be changed in the npm script in package.json
            - For example -> "launchcypress": "./node_modules/.bin/cypress open"
