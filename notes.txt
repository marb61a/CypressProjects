Cypress Testing
    - https://www.cypress.io/ 
    - Before Cypress a tester would have to use multiple tools including
        - A framework such as Mocha, Karma, Jasmine
        - An assertion library like Chai or Expect.js
        - Install the Selenium package
        - Selenium wrappers such as Protractor, Nightwatch and Webdriver
        - Cypress replaces all of this
    - Cypress does not use Selenium and has a different architecture
        - Selenium executes remote command through the network
        - Cypress runs in the same loop as the application 
    - Cypress is not a general automation tool it is an end to end testing tool (E2E)
    - Cypress will work with any framework and on any website
        - It does not matter the JS framework or if the pages are server rendered
    - Cypress tests are written in JavaScript
    - Cypress can be used by both developers and QA testers
    - Cypress runs faster than other frameworks both from  its architecture
        - Also the fact that development can happen simultaneously to testing speeds up the process

Differences between Cypress and Others
